# MEDICAL-MASK-RECOGNITION-USING-DL

Face masks have become an essential tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and respiratory issues like flu. However, not everyone wears them properly or consistently. Therefore, there is a need for an automated system that can detect and monitor face mask usage in public places. In this project, we propose a face mask detector that uses OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and deep learning to perform face detection and face mask classification. Our system consists of two main components: a face detector and a face mask classifier. The face detector can locate faces in a live stream using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with an accuracy of 99%. The face mask classifier is based on the MobileNetV2 model, which can classify faces into two categories: with mask or without mask, using another CNN. We train and test our models on a dataset of 4000 + images of people wearing and not wearing face masks. We evaluate our system on various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We also compare our system with other existing face mask detectors and show that our system achieves better performance. Our system can be deployed on various platforms, such as web applications, mobile devices, or CCTV cameras, to enforce face mask compliance and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
